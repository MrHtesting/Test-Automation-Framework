# ðŸš€ Test Automation Framework

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a robust test automation framework designed for executing automated tests efficiently. It integrates with Cucumber, Selenium, Maven, and Rest Assured to provide seamless test execution and reporting for both UI and API automation.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Execute Tests
You can specify the test scenarios to run by setting the desired **tags** in the `TestRunner.java` class.

To execute the tests, use the following command:
```sh
mvn clean install
```

Alternatively, you can run tests with specific tags:
```sh
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Regression"
```

## ðŸ“Š Reporting
After execution, the test reports are automatically generated:
- **Cucumber Report:** Located in `target/cucumber-reports/`
- **HTML & JSON Reports:** Stored inside the `target/cucumber-reports/`

To view the Cucumber report, open:
```
target/cucumber-reports/index.html
```

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Java 17+**
- **Maven**
- **Google Chrome**
- **Rest Assured** (for API automation)

## ðŸ’ª API Automation with Rest Assured
This framework also supports API automation using **Rest Assured**. API tests can be written to validate endpoints, request/response structures, and integrations.

### Running API Tests
API test scenarios can be tagged accordingly and executed using:::;
```sh
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@API_Test1"
```

API test reports will be available in the same `target/cucumber-reports/` directory.
